# Panda Linux
==============

Panda Linux has two distinct build variants:
A fully featured live image with many packages preinstalled, 
or the minimal build live image with only the bare essentials.

It is recommended to use a program such as Balena-Etcher or Rufus 
to burn the .iso to a USB flash drive for best results.

Download Etcher here:

Once the system is installed, Nvidia users can easily install the
latest Nvidia driver with the Nvidia-Installer utility.

Look in the favourites section of the Panda menu for the Nvidia-Installer shortcut.
